# Pokedex-Web-App
A simple Pokedex web aplication written in HTML, CSS, PHP, JavaScript, and MySQL

This is a project that I developed, along with a team of peers, to demonstrate a thorough understanding of a basic web stack. The front-end uses AngularJS (not required by the course) for handling data and W3.CSS (also not required by the course) for styling. The Angular module retrieves data from the database by making HTTP GET requests to run PHP scripts which query the database and then package the data in JSON format.
